# BMW Sales Analysis using Python & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing BMW sales data using **Python** and applying **Machine Learning techniques** to extract insights and build predictive models. The objective is to understand sales trends, customer preferences, and performance patterns across different years, regions, and car models, and to make data-driven predictions.

The project includes complete data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning model implementation. The results and outputs are documented in the attached PDF.
